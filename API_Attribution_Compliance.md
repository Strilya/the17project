# API Attribution Compliance ✅

## What We Added

Per **Pexels** and **Pixabay** API terms of service:

> "If you make use of the API, show your users where the images and videos are from, whenever search results are displayed."

We've added **automatic attribution watermarks** to comply with free API usage terms.

---

## How It Works

Every video now includes a small watermark at **bottom left:**

- **"Video: Pexels"** - When using Pexels video
- **"Video: Pixabay"** - When using Pixabay video  
- **"Video: Pexels Photos"** - When using photo slideshow

### Visual Example

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│                             │
│      Your Content           │
│      (center text)          │
│                             │
│                             │
│ Video: Pexels    @the17project │
│ (small, subtle)     (branded)  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Watermark Details

**Attribution (Bottom Left):**
- Text: "Video: [Source]"
- Size: 20px (small)
- Opacity: 50% (subtle)
- Color: White

**Your Branding (Bottom Right):**
- Text: "@the17project"
- Size: 40px (larger)
- Opacity: 70%
- Color: Based on style

---

## Why This Matters

✅ **Stays compliant** with Pexels/Pixabay free API terms
✅ **Protects your account** from API suspension
✅ **Supports creators** by showing source attribution
✅ **Looks professional** (small, subtle watermark)

---

## Can I Remove It?

**No.** This is required by the API terms:

- **Pexels:** https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#guidelines
- **Pixabay:** https://pixabay.com/api/docs/

If you remove attribution, you violate the API terms and risk:
- Account suspension
- API key revocation
- Legal issues

---

## Will It Look Bad?

**No!** The attribution is:
- Very small (20px vs your brand at 40px)
- Semi-transparent (50% opacity)
- Bottom left corner (doesn't interfere with content)
- Professional standard (everyone does this)

Many successful Instagram accounts use watermarks. Users expect it.
